FOOS v0.02

FEATURES:
	* Virtual memory
	* Placement malloc()
	* Read-only file system (RAM Drive)
	* Ported liballoc
	* Advanced building system

NOTE:
	As the project grows, the size of the kernel image exaggerates. The
	need of a better reading procedure is required for the bootloader
	to load larger images, so I really need help on reading LBA sectors
	by calling BIOS directly!!!
